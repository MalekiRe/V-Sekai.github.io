## Proposal Workflow

Proposals are committed files: then there is no issue or PR, and the discussion thread, if any, exists on the Discussions tab.

**DO NOT WANT PRs** in an ephemeral PR state but not on master branch, for an undefined times. **Do not want discussions to occur only while the proposal is in the PR state and the discussion is forgotten when it gets "merged" to master**

Merge all open PRs.

For each proposal, create a discussion thread. Then, at the bottom or the top of the proposal, link to the discussion
