# V-Sekai Social VR

**[Interested in V-Sekai or #GodotVR development? Join the V-Sekai discord server!](https://discord.gg/7BQDHesck8)**

## About:

V-Sekai is a community of enthusiasts building a next-generation social and #gaming VR #platform powered by the Godot Engine. We felt there was a need for a remixable ecosystem focused on VR. Social VR should be a truly community-driven experience. For this to be realised, we believe the entire software stack should be available, moddable, and tweakable from the source up, which is why a lot of our projects focus on the MIT-Licensed Godot Engine.

## How you can get involved:

- The group meets ah-hoc in Discord, Web: [v-sekai.org](https://v-sekai.org), Twitter: [https://twitter.com/VSekaiOfficial](https://twitter.com/VSekaiOfficial), Github: [https://github.com/V-Sekai](https://github.com/V-Sekai).
- We track our active tickets with our [Github Issues Backlog](../../issues/)
