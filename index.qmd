V-Sekai is a community of enthusiasts building a next-generation social and #gaming VR #platform powered by the Godot Engine. We felt there was a need for a remixable ecosystem focused on VR. We believe social VR should be a truly community-driven experience. For this to be realised, we believe the entire software stack should be available, moddable, and tweakable from the source up, which is why a lot of our projects focus on the MIT-Licensed Godot Engine.
