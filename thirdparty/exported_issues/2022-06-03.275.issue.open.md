### List the deciders of the issue.

V-Sekai,fire

### Describe the tags of the issue.

V-Sekai,

### Context and Problem Statement

I want to store adjacent information related to V-Sekai in a database.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use baserow.io with managed postgresql, docker and s3 compatible.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Create a app droplet on digital ocean. https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform
2. Use app droplet type docker.
3. Use app droplet image `baserow/baserow:1.10.0`.
4. baserow_data:/baserow/data
5. if you want to connect to Digital Ocean Spaces.

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: The spaces API key.
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: The spaces API secret key.
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME: The name of your space.
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME: Name of the Digital Ocean spaces region (eg. ams3)
    AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL: (eg. https://ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/)
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN: (eg. [name-of-your-space.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com](http://name-of-your-space.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/))
6. `BASEROW_PUBLIC_URL=${PUBLIC_URL}.`
7. `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${baserow-db.USERNAME}:${baserow-db.PASSWORD}@${baserow-db.HOSTNAME}:${baserow-db.PORT}/${baserow-db.DATABASE}`
8. Assign s3 compatible storage via spaces.
8. Should be https://app-name.ondigitalocean.app

### Positive Consequences

I can finally store things.

### Negative Consequences

Pay for the baserow service.

### Option graveyard

- Rejected using premium saas from baserow
- Rejected using airtable

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code, but fairly simple.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I need to store things.
