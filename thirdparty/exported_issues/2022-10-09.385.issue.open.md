### Context and Problem Statement

Load times are too long.


### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

This is a proposal to mask the loading time, but it doesn't solve it.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Join a local room on launch
2. Keep load times low
3. When loading a big server, load on the background until loaded
4. Suggestion: Use a tunnel visualization from common scifi

### Positive Consequences

1. Able to mask loading times
2. Able to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai

### Negative Consequences

1. coordinating cats

### Option graveyard

- Do nothing
- Currently bad because players join and are lost.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We maintain the core.
