## Context and Problem Statement

File or attestation for virtual worlds

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use ssh signatures. 

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

An analogy of a CD and a CD case with stickers.

### 00 VRM avatar attestation

```bash
$ ssh-add -L > me.pub # Can be related to a X.509 `.crt`
$ touch avatar-sample.vrm
$ ssh-keygen -Y sign -f me.pub -n "avatar@v-sekai.org" avatar-sample.vrm
Write signature to avatar-sample.vrm.sig # Can be attested by multiple people with multiple `.sig`
$ echo -n ernest.lee@chibifire.com (String | cat - <(echo -n " ") | cat - <(ssh-add -L) > allowed_signers # Can have more than one line. T
$ ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers -I ernest.lee@chibifire.com -n "avatar@v-sekai.org" -s avatar-sample.vrm.sig < avatar-sample.vrm
Good "avatar@v-sekai.org" signature for ernest.lee@chibifire.com with RSA key SHA256:W7APE+9tyFUdGzzcYCwcdknWm0vb1KPso8XogFP2u+k

```

### 01 Use an X.509 certificate for SSH Login

SSH signatures can be used for:

1. Use for verifying binaries
2. Use for verifying game modifications
3. Used for lobby servers to prove to the player that they are official.
4. Double sided friending

### 02 List of uses for ssh signatures

```bash
# Extract the private key from the P12:
openssl pkcs12 -in my_cert.p12 -out my_cert.pem -nodes
openssl pkcs12 -in my_cert.p12 -out my_sshkeys.pem -nodes -nocerts
# Finally extract the public key from the certificate PEM file and append it to the private key:
openssl x509 -in my_cert.pem -pubkey -noout >> my_sshkeys.pem
# my_cert.pem can now be removed. It is not required anymore.
# You can use ssh-keygen to create the line to put into your remote `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:
ssh-keygen -i -m PKCS8 -f my_sshkeys.pem
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add my_sshkeys.pem

# TODO: fire 2021-11-13 use mbedtls only
```

### 03 Encrypt files

```bash
touch avatar-commission.vrm 
openssl rsautl -encrypt -oaep -pubin -inkey <(ssh-keygen -e -f me.pub -m PKCS8) -in avatar-commission.vrm -out avatar-commission.vrm.enc
openssl rsautl -decrypt -oaep -inkey secret_key.pem -in avatar-commission.vrm.enc -out avatar-commission.vrm.new
# https://www.bjornjohansen.com/encrypt-file-using-ssh-key
# TODO: fire 2021-11-13 decrypt with hardware tokens
```

### 04 Distributing keys

```bash
# Resulting file is namespace.allowed_signers but uri_encoded.
curl https://github.com/fire.keys > avatars%40V-Sekai.com.allowed_signers # Needs a id in email syntax in front of a key 
curl files://uro > avatars%40V-sekai.com.allowed_signers # Assumed in correct format
curl http://matrix-homeserver.example.com/fire > avatars%40V-sekai.com.allowed_signers # Assumed in correct format
```

### 05 Envelope

```bash
# Email multipart

1. Use email multipart

# Uncompressed zip

Avoid compression explosions.

1. zip AvatarSample_A.vrm.sig
2. zip AvatarSample_A.vrm 
```

### 06 

The allowed_signers file associates a string that represents a person (Principle) to a Public Key.

```
# https://blog.sigstore.dev/ssh-is-the-new-gpg-74b3c6cc51c0
USERNAME="fire"
curl https://github.com/${USERNAME}.keys | while read key; do
  echo "$USERNAME $key" >> allowed_signers.github
done
```

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Able to distribute a game launcher.
- Able to add a makers mark to items.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, â€¦]

[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Matrix 
- Rejection Reason: Technically complicated to devops start and multiple layers compared to an offline approach.

- Option: Ipfs and Etherium 
- Rejection Reason: Requires a globally distributed database.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not able to use a few lines of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We have to define the trust.
