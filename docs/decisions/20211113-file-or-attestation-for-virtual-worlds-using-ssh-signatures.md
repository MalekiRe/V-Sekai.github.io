## Context and Problem Statement

File or attestation for virtual worlds

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use ssh signatures. 

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

An analogy of a CD and a CD case with stickers.

### File attestation

Read your public key.

```
$ ssh-add -L > me.pub # Can be related to a X.509 `.crt`
```

Create a file.
```
$ touch avatar-sample.vrm
```

Sign your file.

```
$ ssh-keygen -Y sign -f me.pub -n "avatar@v-sekai.org" avatar-sample.vrm
```

Write signature to avatar-sample.vrm.sig # Can be attested by multiple people with multiple `.sig`

```
$ echo -n ernest.lee@chibifire.com (String | cat - <(echo -n " ") | cat - <(ssh-add -L) > allowed_signers # Can have more than one line. T
```

The allowed_signers file associates a string that represents a person (Principle) to a Public Key.

```
$ ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers -I ernest.lee@chibifire.com -n "avatar@v-sekai.org" -s avatar-sample.vrm.sig < avatar-sample.vrm
Good "avatar@v-sekai.org" signature for ernest.lee@chibifire.com with RSA key SHA256:W7APE+9tyFUdGzzcYCwcdknWm0vb1KPso8XogFP2u+k
```

### List of uses for ssh signatures

SSH signatures can be used for:

1. Use for verifying binaries
2. Use for verifying game modifications
3. Used for lobby servers to prove to the player that they are official.
4. Double sided friending

### How to use a x509 certificate for ssh login

```bash
# Extract the private key from the P12:
openssl pkcs12 -in my_cert.p12 -out my_cert.pem -nodes
openssl pkcs12 -in my_cert.p12 -out my_sshkeys.pem -nodes -nocerts
# Finally extract the public key from the certificate PEM file and append it to the private key:
openssl x509 -in my_cert.pem -pubkey -noout >> my_sshkeys.pem
# my_cert.pem can now be removed. It is not required anymore.
# You can use ssh-keygen to create the line to put into your remote `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:
ssh-keygen -i -m PKCS8 -f my_sshkeys.pem
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add my_sshkeys.pem
# https://trueg.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/use-an-x-509-certificate-for-ssh-login/
# TODO: fire 2021-11-13 use mbedtls only
```

### Encrypt files

A common recommendation is not to combine encryption with authentication.

Use your SSH signature to sign a enveloped list of X.509 certificates and use SMIME.

### Create SSH Certificates

ssh-keygen -f CA
ssh-keygen -s CA -I fire@example.com -n avatar@V-Sekai.com -V +1h KEYFILE.pub

ssh-keygen -Us <(ssh-add -L) -I fire@example.com -n avatar@V-Sekai.com -V +1h KEYFILE.pub

### Distributing keys

```bash
# Resulting file is namespace.allowed_signers but uri_encoded.
curl https://github.com/fire.keys > avatars%40V-Sekai.com.allowed_signers # Needs a id in email syntax in front of a key 
curl files://uro > avatars%40V-sekai.com.allowed_signers # Assumed in correct format
curl http://matrix-homeserver.example.com/fire > avatars%40V-sekai.com.allowed_signers # Assumed in correct format
```

### Envelope

```bash
# Uncompressed zip

Avoid compression explosions.

1. zip AvatarSample_A.vrm.sig
2. zip AvatarSample_A.vrm 

# Email multipart

1. Use email multipart
```

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Able to distribute a game launcher.
- Able to add a makers mark to items.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, â€¦]

[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Matrix 
- Rejection Reason: Technically complicated to devops start and multiple layers compared to an offline approach.

- Option: Ipfs and Etherium 
- Rejection Reason: Requires a globally distributed database.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not able to use a few lines of code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We have to define the trust.
