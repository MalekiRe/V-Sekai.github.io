# Trial install of Teleport for Kubernetes

## Context and Problem Statement

We have trouble installing Kubernetes.

It is difficult to use Kubernetes because of at least these reasons. Networking is hard, storage creation is hard and the number of steps is not split between config and install.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Teleport claims to be a easy to prepare system for preinstalled and airgapped Kubernetes systems.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Create a prototype for a toy problem.

The toy problem is serving the shader motion html/js static website as a Kubernetes application.

Evaluate the complexity.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Increase quality of life
- Easier distributon

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Another layer of complexity

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Kubernetes is a massive project.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is an attempt to use off the shelf tooling.
