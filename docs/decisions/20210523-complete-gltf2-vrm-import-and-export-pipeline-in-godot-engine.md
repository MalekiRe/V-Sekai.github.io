## Context and Problem Statement

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

VRM and glTF import allows us to bring models in and export allows us to get the models out.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

To be determined.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Character import supports
- World export support

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
