# V-Sekai: The universal VR platform

We are a community of enthusiasts building a next-generation social and gaming VR platform powered by the Godot Engine. 

## About V-Sekai

V-Sekai is the first fully-open source social VR platform running on the Godot Engine. It is designed as a living virtual space where you can meet people and interact in a virtual space, while leveraging the fast-growing Godot game engine to let users create any content they want and have it be immediately accessible and shareable to a growing community.
