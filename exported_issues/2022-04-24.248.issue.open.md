I don't think the environment should be a primary in the metaverse.

Legos

second grader. enthusiastic about lego, invite a friend, show off cool things they made, teach something about it

what is environement?
could you take the people out of it? no

one observer? get some value (can touch friends lego but not play)

two? blossoms out because now you can synthesize new virtual realities to roleplay on the fly through improv

three? a crowd. chaotic?

can take HMD to 0, but there is still value.

but you can take the environment out of it??
