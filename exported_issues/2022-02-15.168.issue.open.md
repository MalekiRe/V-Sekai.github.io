# [\#168 Issue](https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/issues/168) `open`: Robustness against NaN: physics integration may cause nan and break the simulation; and serialization (var2str) may produce corrupt unreadable data.

Ideally one nan in the system would not propagate to other parts of the system

This is especially a problem for us because we allow users to bring their own content, but some of this can happen in any networked game
