# V-Sekai project

* V-Sekai is the VR project we'll release e.g. on Itch.io and that developers can mod.
* We're looking to make a full documentation for the modders/developers and end users.
* We have a list of features you need to cover already, that's good.
* Write as efficiently as possible is to immediately create all the draft pages, one for each major feature or topic that you need to cover. Every single major feature needs at least an introduction so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.
* In each page you want to create a bullet list of all the things the user needs to learn to use the feature.
