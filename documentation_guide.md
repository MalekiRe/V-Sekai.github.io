# V-Sekai documentation guide

* V-Sekai is the VR project we'll release, for example, on Itch.io that developers can mod.
* We're looking to make complete documentation for the modders/developers and end users.
* We have a list of features we need to cover already, that's good.
* Write as efficiently as possible to immediately create all the draft pages, one for each significant feature or topic you need to cover. Every prominent feature requires at least an introduction, so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.
* On each page, we want to create a bullet list of all the things the user needs to learn to use the feature.
