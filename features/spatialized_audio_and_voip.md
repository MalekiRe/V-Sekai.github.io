# Spatialised audio and VOIP support

* Audio is a very important part of VR, it helps the user to understand the space around them and what's happening around them.
* Many games and VR applications use spatialization to make it seem like sounds are coming from a specific direction.
* We wrote a custom Godot Engine speech module.
* We made a Godot Engine custom branch for Resonance Audio.
